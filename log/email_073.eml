Message: Hi,
I am realy impressed about this great work. I have installed Itop on a
system without sample data. Now on every new incidet no Team or Person are
in the dropdownlist. If I add them via the plus sign they will appear in
the Teamlist or overwiew but not available to new incidents if you create a
new one. Do you have any idea why my dropdownlist are empty even if the
teams, location, Persons are in the system and showing up in the overwiew ?
 Thanks

Regards
Wolfgang
