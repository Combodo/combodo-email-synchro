Hello Combodo!
Thank you so much for the wonderful product.
I'm interested in any tools you may have for creating/modifying data 
models / databases / classes.
Fully comfortable doing it all line by line, table by table... but as I'm 
planning on adding 15+ columns to the services table along
I thought just reach out and see if you've cooked anything up.

Regards,
