Comments: Hi,
Thanks alot i hope this finds you well. Am setting up iTop on a linux
server and am having an issue with the auto notification. How do i go about
it? The email.test.php seems  working but the auto notification gives me
the following error 'TEST () - Notification was not sent: query syntax
error for recipient 'to' '.
