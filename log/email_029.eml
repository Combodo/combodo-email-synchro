Dear Madam / Sir,

Small introduction:
We are a small JEE developer company in Hungary.
Our main customers are from Bank and Telecommunication sectors.
See little more information about us on our web site (
http://www.imn.hu/?lang=3Den).

I'm a co-owner of IMN and responsible for consultancy and some new leads.

In medias res:
One of our potential customer from Telco (international company) likes to
implement an open source CMDB solution (HD, IM, SD, PM are not important. I=
t
has some special systems for these aims)  .
In connection with this request we found your company as a potential
solution provider.

First of all I'd like to request some information:
1.) Your solution specific questions (Forgive me these, but I started to
test your sytem just 1 days ago :))   :
   a.) Can it authorize the users via LDAP repository? (I think the answer
is yes with apache LDAP connector :))
   b.) Could you send us some information about the CI history functions?
   c.) Can it make export (excel, word etc.) about the selected part of
infrastructure?
   d.) Have your solution any auto discovery function?
   e.) Is it "plugable"? (Can the third party write any plug ins based on
your APIs to it?)
   f.) Probably I was lame, but I couldn't find application management
function on your demo site. (The architecture vizualization is very
important for our customer.)
   g.) How does it costumizable? (see my comment to required funcionality)

2.) Support specific questions:
  a.) Can you send us some information about your support fees and policy?
  b.) Our customer requires first line support on site (in country
actually). How can we your partner in Hungary?

3.) Business specific question:
  a.) Do you have any references in telecommunication sector?


That's all for now!
