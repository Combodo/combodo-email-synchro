Hello,

I have a question about managing licenses, if i create a new license for
let's say MS Office 2007 with a usage limit of 100
and add this license to 45 computers who have MS Office 2007 installed is
there any possibility to see a overall view ?
(amount 100 licenses    45 in use    45 free )  something like this !?
Instead of going to usage screen and count the computers to see how many
have the license.

Thanks.

Jasper van der Veen
