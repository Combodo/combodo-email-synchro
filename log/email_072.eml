Message: Hello,
our company now evaluates software available to support ITILv3 processes
and I appreciate your iTop application. I have a question however. Why does
the application offer to link change requests to incidents and not to
problems and known errors by design? How does this correspond to ITIL? Can
you explain the reason to me?
Best regards
Pavel Stros
