# iTop module : Tickets synchronization via e-mail

## About

This is the base module used in the Mail to ticket automation extension for [iTop](https://github.com/Combodo/iTop).

For more information about this module have a look at the corresponding [extension documentation](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/products/combodo-mail-to-ticket-automation).


## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get a
running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss
additional modules.
