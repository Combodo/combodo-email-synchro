Hi again!

I have not received an answer to this, and was hoping that we could get in
contact soon, as this is rather important for us.
Could you get back to me at as soon as possible.

Best regards,
Robert Myhren

Hi!

We are trying to implement the iTop CMDB in our organization, and for this
we need some custom features.
However, due to the lack of documentation and respons in the community of
iTop, this has proven to be a difficult and slow process.

In order for us to succeed in this implementation, we require some support
from the developers.
The support will have to consists of:

   - Quick respons to development questions
   - Documentation of solution (upon request)
   - Possible online training

What support options do you have for these requirements, and what cost will
this bring?

Best regards,

Robert Myhren
