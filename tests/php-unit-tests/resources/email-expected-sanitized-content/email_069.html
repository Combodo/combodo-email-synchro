R2 with IIS 7 with SMTP configured. Running issue with the e-mail setup
validation script</font>
<br><br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">email.test.php.</font>
<br><br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">The script does not seems to recognize
Window's server properly as it kept asking for the "sendmail_path".
After comment this section out, the SMTP setup working without any issue.

<br><br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Not sure if this a bug for this test
script or something to do with our installation. We figured out the work
around, just wonder if this is a bug. </font>
