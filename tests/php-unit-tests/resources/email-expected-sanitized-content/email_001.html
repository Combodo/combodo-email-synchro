<p>I was wondering what security measures does the iTop product takes to defend itself from hacking attempts at the application level. Of special concern at the OWASP top ten issues: <a href="http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202010.pdf">http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202010.pdf</a><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I scanned your documentation but I been unable to find any security sections or advice on how to set up the product securely. Can you guide me to where security topics are discussed or explained?<br></p>
<p>Thanks<br></p>
