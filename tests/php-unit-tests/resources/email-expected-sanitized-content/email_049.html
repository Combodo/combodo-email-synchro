Message: I have been looking at your product and next stage is to install
and use along side our current helpdesk. Ambercat no longer supported!

We offer services contracs for Telephony so may need to implement some
customisation maybe the mobile CI could be Telephony. Our systems are IP
enable so could track endpoint under network devices, need to use in live
enviroment to list what we require.

Our other service contracts is IP CCTV so this is already ok via servers
and netork devices.

Question:

we use (Sage) ACT 2011 and record all our email history and also links in
to quoting tool Quotewerks whick allows us to track opportunities and
document etc
