<p>Hi All,<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>iTop seems really great for what we are wanting around configuration and change management.  But as a service provider we need to bill our incident and problem labour I can’t see this catered for.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Can you advise if this is in there or if there is a partner application/API that will get the information?<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br></p>
<p><br></p>
