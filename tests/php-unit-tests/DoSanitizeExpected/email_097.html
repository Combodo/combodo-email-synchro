Message: Hi,
I am keen to utilise iToop for both ITIL (software development) and
helpdesk roles.  The one thing missing for adoption within my company is
the multi-site company structure for call logging.  For instance, a client
of ours has 70 sites around the country and have a dedicated helpdesk.  All
our other clients, some multi-site, are logged via the main helpdesk. 
Therefore I have a need to have multiple queues and the ability to log
calls by location rather than by user (as some users may provide relief at
another location).

Is there a roadmap for iTop that would deliver this sort of functionality,
or is this the sort of customisation that should be looking to implement
myself?

Kind Regards,
Phil
