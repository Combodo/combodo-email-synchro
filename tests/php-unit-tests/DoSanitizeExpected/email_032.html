<p>Hi,<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>We are a Norwegian hosting company that have just started looking into iTop.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Our main objective is to move all monitoring templates and monitoring configuration data into a CMDB.<br></span></p>
<p><span>We will then use various tools for monitoring and performance analysis, all getting their configuration from the CMDB.<br></span></p>
<p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>I saw this note saying that “Mustang” would have such features and would be released Q1 2011.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Would  you please give us some more info on this ?<br></span></p>
<p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>--<br></span></p>
<p><span>Regards,<br></span></p>
