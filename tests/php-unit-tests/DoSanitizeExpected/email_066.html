Message: hi,

i install itop, i use mysql 5.1.49 and have a problem with this SQL:
SELECT Service AS s JOIN SLA AS sla ON sla.service_id=s.id JOIN
lnkContractToSLA AS ln ON ln.sla_id=sla.id JOIN CustomerContract AS cc ON
ln.contract_id=cc.id WHERE cc.org_id = 2

sql in select services from catalog.

the error: #1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual
that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use
near 'JOIN SLA AS sla ON sla.service_id=s.id JOIN lnkContractToSLA AS ln ON
ln.sla_id=' at line 1
