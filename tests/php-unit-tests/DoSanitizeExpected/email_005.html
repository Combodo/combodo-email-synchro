<p>Hello,

We found and tested iTop CMDB. It's a good software especially its
design of O/R mapping and i18n.

So, we are preparing Japanese translation of iTop. It's mostly done, but
we need to make sure of meaning of some words. Please let us know about
below:

Change Management:
 - What is the difference of "acceptance" and "approval"?

Configration Management:
- What is the difference of "implement" and "production"?
 - Does "implement" mean "preparing"? "not in service"?
 - Does "production" mean "providing services" or "using now"?
- What does "criticity" mean?

Incident Management:
- What does "ev_timeout" mean?

Service Management:
- What does "Underpinning Contracts" mean?

Ticket Management:
- What does "caller" mean?


We are going to contribute our work to iTop community.

Regads,
 Akira YOSHIYAMA </p>
