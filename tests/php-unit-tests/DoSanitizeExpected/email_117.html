<p>Hi!</p>
<div><br></div>
<div>We are trying to implement the iTop CMDB in our organization, and for this we need some custom features.</div>
<div>However, due to the lack of documentation and respons in the community of iTop, this has proven to be a difficult and slow process.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>In order for us to succeed in this implementation, we require some support from the developers.</div>
<div>The support will have to consists of:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Quick respons to development questions</li>
<li>Documentation of solution (upon request)</li>
<li>Possible online training</li>
</ul>
<div>What support options do you have for these requirements, and what cost will this bring?  </div>
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Robert Myhren</div>
