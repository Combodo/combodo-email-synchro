<p>Hi team,

I would appreciate if I can get your help on customize itop.
I'm trying add a new filed "Type" into PC CI class to address the type
of PC, like laptop or desktop etc.
I added following line into  model.itop-config-mgmt.php :

MetaModel::Init_AddAttribute(new AttributeBoolean("Type",
array("allowed_values"=&gt;new ValueSetEnum('Laptop, Desktop, Blade'),
"sql"=&gt;"result", "default_value"=&gt;null, "is_null_allowed"=&gt;true,
"depends_on"=&gt;array())))

Then I deployed the change via the Toolkit for modifying the data
model. And after check with the toolkit, no problem was found in DB.
However when I try create a new PC CI, the new field did not show up
as my expected. I checked the DB with PHPMyadmin and the field already
be insert into the table.

Do you have any suggestion what else I need to do?

Thanks,

Forest</p>
