<p>Hello iTop Team,

what about registering a booth or talk at Chemnitz Linux Days
for next year, March 2012?

You can find more information about the event at
http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemnitzer_Linux-Tage

Registration for Talks and Demonstration will be on the website around
December 2011. Since this is a very popular German Linux and OpenSource
event, talks and presentation should be in german to reach the widest
possible audience.

It is also possible to become a sponsor of the event:

Kind regards
Daniel Parthey</p>
