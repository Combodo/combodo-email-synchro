Message: We are currently evaluating using ITOP as our CMDB solutions. It
is a very nice package, and very likely we are going to deploy it. 

Few questions, 
1. just want to make sure there is no license needed even if we are going
to use for business purpose right?
2. I understand that there are different support/training services, what
are the cost with all offerings?

Thanks.
