Message: Greetings. First let me say I love your product. It has a very
rich feature set. What I was wondering is if there is a standard way to
skin the interface? I get alot of flicker using Firefox and IE8. It comes
from the Ajax stuff I think. If I could change the look and feel, to
something simpler that would be great. If there is no standard way to do
this, perhaps I could come up with some type of theme templating for iTop
and contribute to your project. Let me know
