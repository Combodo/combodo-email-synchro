<p>Hello,

I'd like to propose a 3-way link swap with your website http://netcmdb.com, where you receive 2 links in exchange
for one of yours.

3-way linking is a very effective link building strategy. Since you're getting the links from third party websites, they appear
totally natural to search engine algorithms. Such inbound links help your website rank higher in Google and other search
engines.

Our partner sites that link to your site are at least 3 years old with a minimum pagerank of PR3.

Visit http://twinlinks.net to submit your website.

Thanks,
Rebecca Wilson

Founder &amp; CEO, TwinLinks
