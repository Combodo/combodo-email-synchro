<p>Dear Sir or Madam,

my name is Tobias Glemser, I work as a security consultant at
Tele-Consulting GmbH, Germany. While searching for a CMDB for our very own
purposes, we discovered multiple vulnerabilities in in iTop version
1.1.181.

According to our disclosure policy, we inform you hereby about the
vulnerabilities in detail before disclosing any information to the public.
Due to the experiences in the past, we will stick to the following time
schedule:
 - no response from you until 2011/09/03: disclosure to the public
 - response from you: disclosure to the public after a security fix is
released, but latest on 2011/11/29 (maybe extended according to further
agreements during the disclosure process)

We respect your work and do support open source projects, so feel free to
ask us for more information of you need one.

I just saw you published 1.2-beta today. It seems you have the same
problems here, as this one works on 1.1 and 1.2-beta:
http://www.combodo.com/itop12-beta/pages/UI.php?auth_user=admin"&gt;alert("Help Me")"
	  - add a database server named "XSS "
	  - import a CSV-File where one cell contains "XSS
"
	  - copy&amp;paste data (which does the same as CSV-import) using
	    1;Test 1
        2;Test 2
        3;Test 3"

    reflected XSS (un-authenticated):

http://$domain/iTop/pages/UI.php?auth_user=admin"&gt;alert("Help
Me")"

http://$domain/iTop/pages/UI.php?c%5bmenu%5d=60&amp;class=Note&amp;currentId=Searc
hFormToAdd_document_list\
	   &amp;description=""&amp;dosearch=1&amp;name=Acunetix&amp;open=1&amp;operation=search\
	   _form&amp;org_id=3&amp;status=draft&amp;type=contract

http://domain/iTop/pages/audit.php?category=%22%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C
/script%3E%22&amp;operation=errors&amp;rule=1

Possible solutions:
    - sanitize all input
