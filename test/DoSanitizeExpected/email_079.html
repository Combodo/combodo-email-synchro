<p>Hello,<br></p>
<div><br></div>
<div>I have a question about managing licenses, if i create a new license for let's say MS Office 2007 with a usage limit of 100</div>
<div>and add this license to 45 computers who have MS Office 2007 installed is there any possibility to see a overall view ?  </div>
<div>(amount 100 licenses    45 in use    45 free )  something like this !?</div>
<div>Instead of going to usage screen and count the computers to see how many have the license.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
