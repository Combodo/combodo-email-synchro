<p>Hello,<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I’m from a company that is pushing this tool internally and with customers (e.g. European Space Agency).<br></p>
<p>Due to look&amp;feel requirements we are integrating our portals with iTop using web services in order to open service requests and incidents.<br></p>
<p>During the investigation I have solved a wsdl problem and have extended the “createIncidentTicket” with “createRequestTicket”.<br></p>
<p>Please let me know if you are interested to receive the new wsdl in order to include it into your next version and to initiate a collaboration that may improve your software.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Have a good day.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
