Running ITOP 1.1 on Window Server 2008 R2 with IIS 7 with SMTP configured. 
Running issue with the e-mail setup validation script

email.test.php.

The script does not seems to recognize Window's server properly as it kept 
asking for the "sendmail_path". After comment this section out, the SMTP 
setup working without any issue. 

Not sure if this a bug for this test script or something to do with our 
installation. We figured out the work around, just wonder if this is a 
bug. 

Thanks.
